        <h1>What is<br>consent?</h1>
        <h2>What does consent mean?</h2>
        <p>People typically talk about consent in the context of some kind of sexual or physical activity with a partner. In a healthy relationship, both (or all) partners are able to openly talk about and agree on what kind of activity they want to engage in. Whether it’s holding hands, kissing, touching, intercourse, or anything else, it’s really important for everyone in the relationship to feel comfortable with what’s happening.</p>
        <p class="end">
            You may have heard the phrase “no means no.” That’s totally true, but it doesn’t really provide a complete picture of consent because it puts the responsibility on one person to resist or accept an activity. It also makes consent about what someone doesn’t want to do, instead of being about openly expressing what they do want to do.</p>

        <h2>Well, how does it work?</h2>
        <p class="end">Some people are worried that talking about or getting consent will be awkward or that it will “ruin the mood,” which is far from true. If anything, the mood is much more positive when both partners feel safe and can freely communicate about what they want. First off, talk about what terms like “hooking up” or “going all the way” mean to each partner. Consider having these conversations during a time when you’re not being physically intimate.
        </p>

        <h2>If you are in the heat if the moment, here are some suggestions of things to say:
        </h2>
        <p class="end">
            Are you comfortable?<br>
            Is this okay?<br>
            Do you want to slow down?<br>
            Do you want to go any further?
        </p>

        <h2>What consent looks like</h2>
        <p class="end">Communicating every step of the way, and respecting that when they don’t say “no,” it doesn’t mean “yes.” Consent is a clear and enthusiastic yes! If someone seems unsure, stays silent, doesn’t respond, or says “Maybe…” then they aren’t saying “yes.”
        </p>

        <h2>What consent does NOT look like</h2>
        <p class="end">Assuming that dressing sexy, flirting, accepting a ride, accepting a drink etc. is in any way consenting to anything more, saying yes (or saying nothing) while under the influence of drugs or alcohol, and saying yes or giving in to something because you feel too pressured or too afraid to say no.</p>
        <p class="end">Consent, age, and legality is also important, and if not followed, can have serious consequences on you, and your partner(s). <a href="https://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/rp-pr/other-autre/clp/faq.html" target="_blank">Read up on the age of consent here</a>.</p>
