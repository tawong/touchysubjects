        <h2 class="size" id="size">Size</h2>
        <h3>Is there a normal penis size?</h3>
        <p>There’s no such thing as normal, but there is an average penis size. The average adult penis size is between 5 and 6 inches when fully erect. The age of development on a penis varies, but an individual born with a penis, on average, will start seeing rapid growth from the age of 12 - 16. Then, it will finish growing between the age of 18 to 21. There’s no real way to tell how large or small someone’s penis may be, so it’s important that regardless of your own size, try not to not compare yourself to others! </p>

        <p>If you’d like to measure your penis, you can do it by placing a washed ruler, or tape measure when you are fully erect. Start by placing the top of the tape measure near the top of your penis, which is the area where it connects to your pubic bone. Push any fat back, and then extend the tape to the tip. </p>

        <p>Not satisfied with your length? It is important to note that many products on the market advertise that they can enhance penis growth. The only way to enhance penis size or girth is through surgery, or injecting botox.</p>

        <p>If you think your penis is:</p>
        <ul>

            <li>Not growing and you are past the age of 21</li>
            <li>Hindering your ability urinate </li>
            <li>Hindering your ability to have sex (due to size, or pain) </li>
        </ul>

        <p class="end">Please see a doctor as soon as possible. Find a list of local clinics near you here.</p>

        <h2 id="hygiene">Hygiene</h2>
        <h3>So you want to shave?</h3>
        <p>Before shaving, take a bath or soak in a tub for at least 5 minutes to soften your
            pubic hair. Make sure you use a new/sharp razor and use an alcohol-free shaving gel to prevent irritation. By being in the shower and using shaving gels, it will help prevent the hair from pulling, achieving a smoother shave and avoiding nicks.</p>
        <p>
            When shaving, pull the skin of your penis taut and shave away from the body. Use
            light, gentle strokes, and rinse often. Reapply shaving cream when needed</p>
        <p>
            Be extra careful when shaving your balls, watch out for skin folds and grooves. They
            can trap lots of bacteria and can cause cellulitis, abscesses, and Fournier gangrene if accidentally cut.</p>

        <p>After you’re done, remember to moisturize. Massage gently with lotion, oil, or aloe vera. Try to avoid scented products as they may irritate.</p>

        <p>If this is your first time shaving, trim your pubic hair with a 1⁄4” blade to make it easier to shave later.</p>

        <p>To trim your pubic hair, you can use a safety razor or a clipper with a 0 or 1 blade. Pull the skin of your penis taut and trim slowly and carefully around your sensitive areas. Once you’ve trim the long hair off your scrotum for the first time, it’s easier to maintain the trimming and shaving while lying down.</p>

        <p class="end">If you do accidentally cut yourself, clean the area with warm water, soap, and alcohol. Hold pressure for 10 to 15 minutes for your blood to clot. If it doesn’t stop, make sure to call your doctor immediately.</p>

        <h3>Cleansing the penis, cut and uncut edition</h3>
        <p>Being uncircumcised means that you have a foreskin, the foreskin is the excess fold of skin that covers the head of your penis. Circumcision involves opening the foreskin and cutting off the excess skin.
        </p>
        <p class="end">If you are uncircumsized, smegma may build up within the folds of your foreskin. Smegma is the accumulation of dead skin cells, oil, and bacteria that build up under the foreskin. It may cause odour and eventually harden causing irritation if left uncleaned. To wash your penis, you want to gently pull the foreskin back. Be careful when pulling on your foreskin, don’t force it in case the smegma has hardened. If you find that it has harden, use some rubbing oil to help loosen it. Make sure you use a mild soap and warm water, thoroughly rinse, and then pat dry. Lastly, pull the foreskin back over your penis.
        </p>

        <h2 id="ee">Erections &amp; Ejaculation</h2>
        <p>Most of the time, during the day, your penis is in a flaccid state, meaning it is soft. An erection (aka. a boner / a stiffy / a hard on) is when your penis fills with blood and stretches in size. Usually, you get an erection when you are sexually aroused or when you stimulate your penis. After time, usually your erection will just go away normally or when you ejaculate. Ejaculating is when your penis releases semen at orgasm.</p>

        <p>It’s completely normal to get an erection when you least expect it during the day or while sleeping. A wet dream is when you ejaculate in your sleep, sometimes they can be from sexual dreams or even just stimulation from rubbing against your sheets. You can even get an erection when you aren’t thinking of anything sexual, it’s all just a part of puberty. Rest assured, typically, after puberty, the number of unwanted erections and wet dreams decreases. </p>

        <p>Usually when you ejaculate, you have an orgasm. However, you can have an orgasm without ejaculating at all. Semen (aka. jizz / cum) contains sperm and can cause pregnancy when it enters a vagina. Learn more on vaginal sex and birth control options <a href="#">here.</a></p>

        <p class="end">Before ejaculation, a white fluid called Pre-cum/Pre-ejaculation comes out of your penis when you’re sexually stimulated. Pre-cum can carry sperm if you haven’t peed before your last ejaculation and now.
        </p>

        <h2 id="transitioning">Transitioning</h2>
        <p class="end">Transitioning is the process of changing your gender presentation to match your gender identity. There are many ways to transition, some including medically and socially. Medical transitioning can involve medical treatment and hormone injections. Socially transitioning often includes changing your name, preferred pronouns, or dressing differently. <a href='#'>Learn more about sexualities, sexuality and gender</a>.</p>

        <h3>Transitioning with a penis</h3>
        <p>For trans men (FTM), a medical transition can include:</p>
        <p class="end">
            Hormone therapy (to create masculine characteristics such as a deeper voice, facial hair growth, muscle
            growth, redistribution of body fat away from hips and breasts, not getting a period, etc.)<br>
            Male chest reconstruction, or “top surgery” (removal of breasts and breast tissue)<br>
            Hysterectomy (removal of internal female reproductive organs such as the ovaries and uterus)<br>
            Phalloplasty (construction of a penis using skin from other parts of your body)<br>
            Metoidioplasty (surgery that causes your clitoris to work more like a penis, along with hormone treatment
            to make your clitoris grow larger)</p>

        <h3>Transitioning into having a penis</h3>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p class="end">

            fat toward hips and breasts, etc.)<br>
            Breast augmentation (implants)<br>
            Orchiectomy (removal of testes)<br>
